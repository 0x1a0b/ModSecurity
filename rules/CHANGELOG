Version 1.3.2 - 2006/12/27 

New events:
- 960037  Directory is restricted by policy
- 960038  HTTP header is restricted by policy

Regular expressions fixes:
- Regular expressions with @ at end of beginning (for example "@import)
- Regular expressions with un-escaped "."
- Command Injections now always require certain characters both before and after the command. Important since many are common English words (finger, mail)
- The command injection wget is not searched in the UA header as it has different meaning there.
- LDAP Fixed to reduce FPs:
	+ More accurate regular expressions
	+ high bit characters not accpeted between signature tokens.
- Do not detect <?xml as a PHP tag in both PHP injection and PHP source leakage
- Removed Java from automation UA
- When validating encoding, added regexp based chained rule that accepts both %xx and %uxxxxx encoding bypassing a limitation of "@validateUrlEncoding"

Additional rules logic:
- Checks for empty headers in addition to missing ones  (Host, Accept and User-Agent)
- OPTIONS method does not require an accept header.
- Apache keep alive request exception.
- PROPFIND and OPTIONS can be used without content-encoding (like HEAD and GET)
- Validate byte range checks by default only that no NULL char exists.
- Added CSS to allowed extensions in strict rule sets.
- Changed default action in file #50 to pass instead of deny.
- Moved IP host header from protocol violations to protocol anomalies.

Modified descriptions: 
- 950107: URL Encoding Abuse Attack Attempt
- 950801: UTF8 Encoding Abuse Attack Attempt
- Added matched pattern in many events using capture and %{TX.0}
- Added ctl:auditLogParts=+E for outbound events and attacks to collect response.
